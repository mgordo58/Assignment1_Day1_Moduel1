    "Requirement Analysis: Focuses on the tasks that determine the needs or conditions to meet new or altered products or projects. It also takes into account the possibly conflicting requirements of the various analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing software or it's system requirements.\n",

    "Design: A process of planning and organizing the structure and functionality of a computer program before its implementation. This involves identifying a problem to be solved, determining the requirements for the program, and outlining the algorithms and data structures that will be used to solve the problem by creating flowcharts, pseudocode, IPO (Input,Process,output) or other visual representations for the program's structure to aid in the development process.\n",

    "Implementation: Refers to installing new hardware, software, or applications. It can also mean the inclusion of a specific technical specification, software component or a software development tool that contain implementations of a programming language.\n",

    "Testing: Checking the functionality and performance of a software before or durning the launching of a programs sorfware or hardware. This involves testing the unit by testing on an individual unit in an application, testing the system programming, and the integration of the software on groups of application units to see how they work together.\n",
